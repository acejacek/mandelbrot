# Basic implementation of Mandelbrot in C

Inspired by [coding challenge #21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z7GQewK-Ks) on The Coding Train.

## Usage

Compile from source code:

```bash
make
```

Execute from command line:

```bash
./manbelbrot
```

Program generates Mandelbrot fractal, saved as `mandelbrot.ppm` file in [PPM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm#PPM_example) format. Can be viewed with:

```bash
xdg-open mandelbrot.ppm
```
